# Drum-Kits
The Virtual Drum Kit project is an interactive web application that simulates a digital drum kit. It allows users to play various drum sounds by clicking on different drum components displayed on the screen. The project is built using HTML for the structure and CSS for the styling of the drum kit components.![drumkit](https://github.com/rathore-2002/Drum-Kits/assets/92203739/4e56261c-103a-4f33-928f-91903ffced39)
